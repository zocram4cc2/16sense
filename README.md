# 16sense
## Gameplay patch for Pro Evolution Soccer 2016

16sense is the gameplay patch developed for the [4chan cup](https://implyingrigged.info/) for its use in PES2016. This is achieved like the previous PES2021 patch by changing the binary constants file Konami left in the game's data packs. Its name is loosely inspired by pfSense, a product so named because "it makes sense of pf". This patch aims to "make sense" of PES 2016.
